Here's an example of how you can create a Go function to handle concurrent API requests with rate limiting using Go's built-in concurrency features and the `github.com/valyala/fasthttp` package, which provides an HTTP server that supports rate limiting.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "net/http"

    // Import the fasthttp package for rate limiting
    _ "github.com/valyala/fasthttp"
)

// ConcurrentAPIRequests handles concurrent API requests with rate limiting.
func ConcurrentAPIRequests(ctx context.Context, req *http.Request) {
    // Create a new FastHTTP request handler
    reqHandler := fasthttp.NewRequestHandle(req.Method, req.URL.Path)

    // Set the rate limiting parameters (in this case, 1000 requests per minute)
    reqHandler.SetRateLimit(1000, 60)

    // Generate a random delay to simulate load testing
    delay := rand.Intn(10) * 100

    // Simulate a long-running request (e.g., an API call)
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Request:", req.Method, req.URL.Path)
        // Your actual API request code here...
        time.Sleep(delay * time.Second)
    }()

    // Call the main function to continue processing requests
}

func main() {
    // Initialize the random number generator for load testing
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

    // Create a new HTTP server
    httpServer := &http.Server{
        Handler: http.HandlerFunc(ConcurrentAPIRequests),
    }

    // Listen on port 8080 and serve requests concurrently with rate limiting
    fmt.Println("Listening on port 8080...")
    if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ConcurrentAPIRequests` function is a handler for HTTP requests that simulates concurrent API requests with rate limiting. The function uses Go's concurrency features to run multiple requests concurrently while enforcing rate limits.

Please note that you'll need to replace the `// Your actual API request code here...` comment with your actual API request code, which would involve sending an HTTP request to a remote server and parsing the response.

This example uses version 3 of the rate limiting scheme, where only a specified number of requests are allowed within a certain time window (60 seconds in this case). The `SetRateLimit` method is used to set the rate limit for a given route.
