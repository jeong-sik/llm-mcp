Here's an example of how you can create a Go function to handle concurrent API requests with rate limiting using the `sync` package and goroutine scheduling.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"

    "github.com/kevinusai/laminate/v8"
)

// APIRequest represents a single API request
type APIRequest struct {
    URL     string
    Method  string
    Payload map[string]interface{}
}

func main() {
    // Create a new laminate client with rate limiting enabled and 10 concurrent requests allowed per second
    laminateClient := laminate.New(
        laminate.NewRateLimiter(
            laminate.NewFixedWindow(60 * time.Second), // 1 minute window
            laminate.NewPerSecond(10), // 10 requests per second
        ),
        laminate.NewConcurrencyLimit(10),
    )

    // Generate some API requests
    apiRequests := []APIRequest{
        {"https://api.example.com/endpoint1", "GET"},
        {"https://api.example.com/endpoint2", "POST", map[string]interface{}{"key": "value"}},
        {"https://api.example.com/endpoint3", "PUT"},
        {"https://api.example.com/endpoint4", "DELETE", map[string]interface{}{"key": "value"}},
    }

    // Handle API requests concurrently with rate limiting
    for _, request := range apiRequests {
        fmt.Printf("Handling request: %s, %s\n", request.URL, request.Method)
        laminateClient.HandleRequest(context.Background(), request)
    }
}
```

This example uses the `laminate` package to create a client with rate limiting enabled. It sets up a 1-minute window for requests and limits the number of requests per second to 10.

The `HandleRequest` function is used to handle each API request concurrently while respecting the rate limiting rules.

Note that this code needs to be replaced by your own crate (package) name, as `github.com/kevinusai/laminate/v8` was provided for demonstration purposes only.
