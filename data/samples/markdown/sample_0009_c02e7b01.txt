**Database Schema Technical Specification (Variation 9)**

**Overview**

This document outlines the technical specifications for our database schema, which will be used to store and manage data for our application. The schema is designed to accommodate a wide range of data types and relationships, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

**Database Structure**

The database consists of three main components: **Users**, **Products**, and **Orders**.

### 1. Users Table

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id (Primary Key) | int | Unique identifier for each user |
| username | varchar(50) | Username chosen by the user |
| password_hash | varchar(255) | Hashed password stored securely |
| email | varchar(100) | User's email address |
| created_at | timestamp | Timestamp when the user account was created |

### 2. Products Table

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id (Primary Key) | int | Unique identifier for each product |
| name | varchar(100) | Product name |
| description | text | Brief product description |
| price | decimal(10, 2) | Product price |
| image_url | varchar(255) | URL of the product image |
| category_id (Foreign Key) | int | Category ID that belongs to this product |

### 3. Orders Table

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id (Primary Key) | int | Unique identifier for each order |
| user_id (Foreign Key) | int | User ID who placed the order |
| order_date | timestamp | Timestamp when the order was created |
| total_cost | decimal(10, 2) | Total cost of the order |

### 4. Order Items Table

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id (Primary Key) | int | Unique identifier for each order item |
| order_id (Foreign Key) | int | Order ID that this item belongs to |
| product_id (Foreign Key) | int | Product ID of the item |
| quantity | int | Quantity of the item in the order |

### 5. Categories Table

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id (Primary Key) | int | Unique identifier for each category |
| name | varchar(50) | Category name |
| description | text | Brief category description |

**Indexing and Constraints**

* Primary keys: `id` in Users, Products, Orders, Order Items, and Categories
* Foreign keys:
 + User ID references the id in Users
 + Product ID references the id in Products
 + Order ID references the id in Orders
 + Category ID references the id in Categories
* Indexes:
 + Create a composite index on `Users` for efficient username lookups
 + Create a composite index on `Products` for efficient product name and category lookups

**Data Types**

* Integer values will be stored as signed 32-bit integers (int)
* Decimal values will be stored with a maximum of 10 digits before the decimal point and 2 digits after the decimal point (decimal(10, 2))
* String values will be stored as Unicode strings using UTF-8 encoding

**Storage**

The database will be stored on a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

**Backup and Recovery**

Regular backups of the database will be performed to ensure data integrity and availability. In case of a failure, the backup data can be restored to restore the original state of the database.

By following this technical specification, we aim to create a robust and scalable database schema that meets our application's requirements.
