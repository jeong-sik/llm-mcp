**Technical Specification: Database Schema Variation 4**

**Overview**

The following technical specification outlines the database schema variation 4, which is designed to support a scalable and efficient data storage solution for a web-based application. The schema will be implemented in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

**Database Structure**

The database will consist of five main tables: Users, Accounts, Transactions, Products, and Orders.

### Table 1: Users

*   **Table Name:** `users`
*   **Columns:**
    *   `id` (primary key): Unique identifier for each user
    *   `username`: Username chosen by the user
    *   `email`: Email address associated with the user
    *   `password_hash`: Hashed password stored securely
    *   `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for when the user account was created and last updated

### Table 2: Accounts

*   **Table Name:** `accounts`
*   **Columns:**
    *   `id` (primary key): Unique identifier for each account
    *   `user_id` (foreign key): References the `id` column in the `users` table
    *   `account_number`: Account number assigned to the user
    *   `balance`: Current balance of the account
    *   `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for when the account was created and last updated

### Table 3: Transactions

*   **Table Name:** `transactions`
*   **Columns:**
    *   `id` (primary key): Unique identifier for each transaction
    *   `account_id` (foreign key): References the `id` column in the `accounts` table
    *   `transaction_type`: Type of transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal)
    *   `amount`: Amount of the transaction
    *   `timestamp`: Timestamp for when the transaction occurred

### Table 4: Products

*   **Table Name:** `products`
*   **Columns:**
    *   `id` (primary key): Unique identifier for each product
    *   `name`: Product name
    *   `description`: Product description
    *   `price`: Price of the product
    *   `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for when the product was created and last updated

### Table 5: Orders

*   **Table Name:** `orders`
*   **Columns:**
    *   `id` (primary key): Unique identifier for each order
    *   `user_id` (foreign key): References the `id` column in the `users` table
    *   `product_id` (foreign key): References the `id` column in the `products` table
    *   `quantity`: Quantity of products ordered
    *   `order_date`: Date and time when the order was placed
    *   `status`: Status of the order (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered)

**Indexing Strategy**

To optimize query performance, indexing will be used on the following columns:

*   `users.id`
*   `accounts.user_id`
*   `accounts.account_number`
*   `transactions.account_id`
*   `products.id`
*   `orders.user_id`

**Constraints**

The following constraints will be enforced in the database schema:

*   Primary keys: Unique identifiers for each row
*   Foreign keys: References to related tables
*   Check constraints: Validation rules for specific columns (e.g., email address format)
*   Default values: Default values for certain columns

**Normalization Level**

The database schema will be normalized to the third normal form (3NF), ensuring that each non-key attribute depends on the entire primary key.

**Data Type Standardization**

Standardized data types will be used throughout the database schema:

*   Integer data type for whole numbers
*   Decimal data type for decimal values
*   Timestamp data type for date and time information

By following this technical specification, a scalable and efficient database schema can be designed to support the web-based application.
