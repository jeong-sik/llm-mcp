2.  Navigate into the cloned directory using `cd project-name`
3.  Install all required dependencies and libraries using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies from your global Python environment. You can do this by running `python -m venv env` (for Windows) or `python3 -m venv env` (for Unix/Linux/Mac). Activate the virtual environment using `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows or `source env/bin/activate` on Unix/Linux/Mac.
