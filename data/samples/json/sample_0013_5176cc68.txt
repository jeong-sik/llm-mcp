Here's an example of a JSON error response in Variation 3 format:

```
{
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid request",
    "details": {
        "errorType": "validationError",
        "invalidFields": [
            {
                "field": "username",
                "errorMessage": "Username is required"
            },
            {
                "field": "email",
                "errorMessage": "Email is invalid"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this response, we have a code of 400 (Bad Request), a message indicating that the request was invalid. The details section includes an error type and a list of invalid fields with their corresponding error messages.
