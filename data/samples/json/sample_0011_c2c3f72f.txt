Here is an example of a JSON configuration file that includes database and cache settings:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "type": "mysql",
    "host": "localhost",
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "name": "your_database_name",
    "port": 3306,
    "timeout": 30
  },
  "cache": {
    "type": "redis",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 6379,
    "db": 0,
    "prefix": "your_app_prefix:"
  },
  "server": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3000,
    "secure": false
  }
}
```

This configuration includes the following settings:

- Database:
  - Type: The type of database to use (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
  - Host: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
  - Username: The username to use for connecting to the database.
  - Password: The password to use for connecting to the database.
  - Name: The name of the database to connect to.
  - Port: The port number to use when connecting to the database.
  - Timeout: The maximum amount of time to wait for a response from the database.

- Cache:
  - Type: The type of cache to use (e.g. Redis, Memcached, etc.)
  - Host: The hostname or IP address of the cache server.
  - Port: The port number to use when connecting to the cache.
  - DB: The database number to use for the cache.
  - Prefix: A prefix to use for cache keys.

- Server:
  - Host: The hostname or IP address of the server.
  - Port: The port number to use when running the application.
  - Secure: Whether to run the application in secure mode (i.e. HTTPS).

Note that this is just an example configuration, and you should adjust the settings to fit your specific needs.
