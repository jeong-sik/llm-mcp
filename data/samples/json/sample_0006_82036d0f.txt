Here is an example of a JSON configuration file that includes settings for a web application, including database and cache configurations, following variation 6:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "type": "postgres",
    "username": "your_database_username",
    "password": "your_database_password",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "your_database_name"
  },
  "cache": {
    "driver": "redis",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 6379,
    "password": "",
    "db": 0
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 3000,
    "host": "0.0.0.0"
  }
}
```

In this configuration, we have the following settings:

- **database**: The type of database used is `postgres`, and you should replace `your_database_username`, `your_database_password`, `your_database_name` with your actual database credentials.
- **cache**: We are using Redis as the cache driver. You can adjust the host, port, password, and database settings according to your needs.
- **server**: The server is listening on `port 3000` and is accessible from any address.

Remember that this configuration file should be stored in a safe location (like `.env`) because it contains sensitive information like passwords.
