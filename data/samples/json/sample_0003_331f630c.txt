Here's an example of a JSON error response in variation 3:

```json
{
    "error_code": 500,
    "message": "Internal Server Error",
    "details": [
        {
            "field_name": "username",
            "error_message": "Username cannot be empty"
        },
        {
            "field_name": "email",
            "error_message": "Invalid email address"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, the error response includes:

*   An `error_code` of 500 to indicate an internal server error.
*   A `message` describing the general nature of the error.
*   A `details` array containing specific error messages for each field that caused the validation failure.

This structure allows for easy modification and extension of error handling mechanisms, while providing a clear indication of the source and nature of errors encountered by an application.
