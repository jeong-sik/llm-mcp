Here's an example of a JSON configuration file that includes database and cache settings for a web application, following variation 6:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "type": "mysql",
    "host": "localhost",
    "username": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "port": 3306,
    "name": "mydb"
  },
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "redis",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 6379,
    "database": 0
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "pattern": "%date% - %logger% - %message%",
    "file": "/var/log/myapp.log"
  }
}
```

In this configuration, we have the following settings:

- Database: The database type is MySQL and it's running on `localhost` with username `root`, password `password`, port `3306`, and name `mydb`.
- Cache: The cache system is Redis, running on `localhost` at port `6379`. We're using Redis's default database number `0`.
- Logging: The logging level is set to `INFO` and it will log the date, logger, and message in this pattern. The logs are written to a file named `/var/log/myapp.log`.

Please note that these values should be replaced with your actual application's settings.

Here's an additional configuration for Redis cache with a time to live (TTL) of 1 hour:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "type": "mysql",
    "host": "localhost",
    "username": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "port": 3306,
    "name": "mydb"
  },
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "redis",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 6379,
    "database": 0,
    "ttl": 3600 // Time to live in seconds
  }
}
```

This will set the time to live for cached data to 1 hour, meaning that after 1 hour of inactivity, Redis will delete the key.
