Here's an example of a JSON error response with code, message, and details in variation 8:

```
{
    "error": {
        "code": "E001",
        "message": "Invalid request",
        "details": [
            {
                "field": "username",
                "reason": "Username cannot be empty"
            },
            {
                "field": "password",
                "reason": "Password must be at least 8 characters long"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this response, the code `E001` indicates a general error, while the message "Invalid request" provides a brief description of the issue. The details section contains two specific errors that occurred during validation: one for an empty username and one for a password that is too short.
