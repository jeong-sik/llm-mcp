Here is an example of how you can create a JSON object with user profile data, including name, email, and preferences:

```json
{
  "name": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  },
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "preferences": [
    { 
      "preference_id": 1, 
      "option_1": true,
      "option_2": false
    },
    {
      "preference_id": 2, 
      "option_3": true,
      "option_4": false
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the user's name is stored in an object with two properties: `first_name` and `last_name`. The email address is a simple string. The preferences are stored in an array of objects, where each object has three properties: `preference_id`, `option_1`, and `option_2` (or `option_3` and `option_4`).
